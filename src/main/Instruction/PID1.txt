Create a Command that uses the WPI PID Controller class to drive the simulated Arm1 subsystem to a desired position.

The arm starts at 0 degrees and can physically rotate continuously in either direction without limitation.

Invoke your Command with the following arm positions. As soon as a position is reached, start a command to go to the next position using the least movement possible.
	45 degrees, 135 degrees, 0 degrees, -179 degrees, 179 degrees, -90 degrees, 90 degrees
